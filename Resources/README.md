Our Current Resources:

* **Getting Started with Arduino:** This page gives instructions on setting up Arduino that will become useful if we decide to go the Arduino route. 

* **Arduino Tutorials:** This page provides tutorials for smaller Arduino projects. These tutorials could be useful stepping stones in learning how to accomplish larger tasks leading up to our final product.

* **Raspberry Pi Resources:** This page has resources for learning Raspberry Pi from start to finish. The teach tab provides learning schemes, of which the "Sensing Science" scheme may be useful. The learn tab provides exercises for learning Raspberry Pi, where the "Physical Computing with Python" exercises might be useful.
