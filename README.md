Project Name:

Modular Internet-of-Things Remote Server and Interface

Description:

Our planned project is a remote service that will be running on a Raspberry Pi/Arduino or similar hardware that supports interaction with different types of sensors and devices. In addition to this server service, a client application will be designed to provide a streamlined and convenient way for the user to adjust and check the functions of the sensors and devices. We are also considering some Artificial Intelligence options to provide a learning facet to the server to further user convenience and hopefully ultimately remove the human factor from the equation. 
	
We will now delve into the following specifics:
	
		- Description of Files and Folders
		- Explain packages and resources
		- Explain how to look through the repo
		- Help navigate the repo 

Our project contains the following files and folders:

* **Documents:** Folder that will contain documents describing the project. 

* **Source:** Folder that will contain all of our source code. Subdirectories will be organized by programming languages. 

We don't currently have any packages, however we do have a folder from the boiler plate for resources.

* **Resources:** Resources will be included here, such as helpful websites and the like.

Instructions for looking through the repo:

* **Documents:** Start by looking through the documents we have prepared to describe our project. This folder currently only has the provided materials from the boiler-plate.

* **Source:** Continue on to the source folder if you wish to see the development of the code. Internal comments on the code will provide further explanation.

* **Resources:** Visit this folder if you are looking for where we got information or ideas from. This will be our base of research and a place to gather all helpful materials for quick look-up.

Navigation of the repo can be reflected with the previous points and will be expanded on when our project isn't empty.
