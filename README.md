Project Name:

Modular Internet-of-Things Remote Server and Interface

Description:

Our planned project is a remote service that will be running on a Raspberry Pi/Arduino or similar hardware that supports interaction with different types of sensors and devices. In addition to this server service, a client application will be designed to provide a streamlined and convenient way for the user to adjust and check the functions of the sensors and devices. We are also considering some Artificial Intelligence options to provide a learning facet to the server to further user convenience and hopefully ultimately remove the human factor from the equation.

Project Boiler Plate for UWyo COSC 4950/5
=========================================

This is nothing more than a directory structure to use for starting a new project.  
It contains the following folders:

* **Source:** All of our source code. Subdirectories are organized by programming languages. If we end up using an IDE, we may consider starting the project here.

* **Documents:** Documents describing the project. 

The boiler plate includes a use case template and a sample use case.  Both of these
  are taken from [Cockburn's use cases website][1], which contains many other useful tips
  on writing effective use cases (as does his book).  The use cases are written
  down in [Markdown][2] format. This folder also includes a sample specification document from a real
  software company to serve as an example throughout the project.

* **Resources:** Resources will be included here, such as helpful websites and the like.
